# python-data-manipulation-example

## 📄 Overview

This project is a **basic data manipulation example** using a fictional student dataset. The goal is to clean raw data, engineer new features, and explore performance insights using Python.

## 📊 Key Steps

- Loaded and inspected Students_Dummy_Data.csv (this file is included in the repository).
- Handled missing values in scores and names
- Created `total_score` and `average_score` columns
- Split `student_info` into `first_name`, `gender`, and `grade`
- Filtered Grade A students
- Calculated average score by gender
- Sorted top performers
- Saved cleaned data to `Students_Final_Data.csv`

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python, pandas, NumPy
- Google Colab
